# DemographicsVsCOVID-19

Effect of age, gender, race, ethnicity on COVID-19 symptoms

We are trying to predict whether an individual, based on her/his demographics, is expected to show symptoms, if infected with COVID-19. There are many possible uses for such a model (For ex: in policymaking: if we conclude that males are more likely to show symptoms, we could allocate resources for more testing among females, as they tend to be more asymptomatic and are more likely to be infected, undetected). 
We consider an individual’s age group, gender, race and ethnicity as features.

We predict whether an individual is expected to show symptoms using the following classifiers:
•	Logistic regression
•	Decision tree
•	Random forest
•	Linear discriminant analysis
•	Naïve Bayesian

The dataset is a public dataset from CDC, available on: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf
